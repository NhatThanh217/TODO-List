Our goal for this project was fairly (maybe overly) simple â€“ an application to track and manage a to-do list. Core functionality includes obvious things like adding a task to the list, removing a task, editing a task, etc. 
It was not hard to scale up the complexity. While we ditched some ideas, like adding an alarm to remind the user to perform a task, we kept some others. By adding Manager profiles who could oversee their teams To Do lists, we expanded possible users to include businesses, increasing the potential profitability. 

We made a point of utilizing technologies that are commonplace but not necessarily familiar to us. We decided on a web application, using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and PHP for the frontend and a SQL database to store application content, user profiles, lists, and tasks on the backend.  
However, right now we still not complete on backend section.

At this time, we use username 'user1' and password '123' for credential login . In homepage , we have functions CRUD tasks, mard as done after finished it and share task as well. Moreover, we can search tasks or filter tasks. On the menu bar, we can show the tasks by  today, upcoming or team, etc.
